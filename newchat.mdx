---

Engaging in conversation with AI models in Vello is a seamless experience. Here's how to start a new chat with AI:

1. **Create a New Chat**: Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+M` or click on the 'New Chat' button at the top right corner to start the process. Create an empty chat without a default AI model using `Option+Shift+N` (or `Alt+Shift+N`).

2. **Select AI Model**: At the top of the chat creation screen, you will see tabs representing pinned models/personas in the space. Choose from these options or click the '+'  button in the chat header or press `Ctrl+E` to open a selector.

3. **Choose Models or Personas or Team Members**: From the selector, you can pick one or multiple AI models or some of your team to include in your chat. This flexibility allows for varied input and multi-model, multi-person conversations.

4. **Adjust Membership as Needed**: At any point, you can adjust the chatâ€™s membership, press `Ctrl+E` or use the '+' in the header.  Press backspace to remove existing members, or search by name to add new ones.

5. **Navigate Between Pinned Models**: Once the chat is active, you can easily switch between pinned models by using the keyboard shortcuts `Ctrl+H` and `Ctrl+L` or by clicking the corresponding tabs.

6. **Engage in Chat**: After selecting your preferred AI model or personas, you can begin typing your queries or commands, and the AI will respond in the conversation thread.
