In Vello, every chat has an associated static markdown note that serves as a collaborative editing space. This document can be accessed by clicking the arrow icon in the top right corner or using the shortcut `Ctrl+]`. Here, you and your team can keep permanent notes and collaborate in real-time, editing and refining content as you interact with other members and the AI.

***This very documentation site was initially generated via [a conversation with the document model](https://vello.ai/share/aqbgz81u).***

1. **Accessing the Document**: Toggle the document panel in any chat to start editing the markdown note associated with that conversation.

2. **Edit and Collaborate**: Type or paste text directly into the document. You, your team members, or the Document Editing model can then make edits, which are reflected in real-time for all collaborators.

3. **Interacting with the AI**: When you require assistance with your document, you can directly interact with the AI in the chat. Ask for editing suggestions, content generation, or other document-related tasks.

4. **Document Formatting with Markdown**: The document supports markdown formatting, giving you and your team the flexibility to structure and stylize your notes as needed.

The integration of document functionality within the chat experience provides a seamless workflow, making it easy to maintain context while collaboratively working on content.
