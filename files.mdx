title: Chatting with Files
---

Vello extends the collaboration experience with the ability to chat around, and interact with, various types of files. This enhances the way you can use AI to work alongside your documents and data.

#### **Attaching Files to Chats**

To involve a file in your conversation:

1. **Upload a File**: Click the document icon to the left of the message input box or simply drag and drop a file there. The supported file formats include text/code files, PDFs, HTML, PPTX, CSV, XML, ZIP, and image files.

2. **Interact with the File**: Once uploaded, personas that can chat with files will be able to read and interact with it. For example, they can summarize the content, answer questions based on the data, or write and validate code contained within.

3. **Utilizing Code**: With AI models that specialize in code, you can validate, execute, or debug snippets directly from your chat, as well as work with XML or ZIP files that contain code projects or datasets.

#### **Working with URLs**

Additionally, the web search model is designed to work with files via URL. You can provide a URL to any webpage or PDF document, and the model can read and analyze the content, integrating this analysis into the conversation.
