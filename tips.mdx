title: Tips and Tricks for Better Chat
---

To make your interaction with Vello's AI as smooth and efficient as possible, here are some tips and tricks you'll find handy:

1. **Stopping an AI Response**: If the AI is composing a reply and you need to stop it immediately, use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+S` or simply hit the stop button in the chat interface.

2. **Regenerate a Response**: Sometimes you might want the AI to take another crack at the last reply. Simply press the regenerate icon inside the input, or `Ctrl+R` to regenerate the previous response.

3. **Undo the Last AI Response**: If you feel the need to step back and ask your question differently, use the `Ctrl+D` shortcut. It erases the last AI response and places your original message back into the input area for adjustments.

4. **Verbose Mode for Detailed Responses**: When you require more comprehensive replies, engage verbose mode by pressing `Option+V`. This allows you to use the Enter key for line breaks and format your query more expansively. Submit your entry with `Shift+Enter`.

5. **Duplicate Chat for Exploring Different Paths**: With `Option+C`, you can duplicate an ongoing chat. This is particularly useful if you want to pursue different lines of inquiry or discussion without losing the current chat flow.

6. **Focus on the Chat Input Box**: Quickly bring your cursor to the chat input box to type a new message or command by using `Cmd+I` on macOS or `Ctrl+I` on Windows. This shortcut allows you to quickly start typing without having to use the mouse to click into the text area.

7. **Cycle Through Chat Rooms**: You can quickly navigate to the next or previous chat rooms by using `Option+J` to move to the next chat room or `Option+K` to go back to the previous one on macOS. On Windows, use `Ctrl+J` and `Ctrl+K` respectively. This allows you to efficiently manage multiple conversations without taking your hands off the keyboard.

By leveraging these shortcuts and features, you can navigate your conversations more naturally and make the most out of your time with the AI models in Vello.
