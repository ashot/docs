To make your interaction with Vello's AI as smooth and efficient as possible, here are some tips and tricks you'll find handy:
*Note: On Windows, use `Ctrl` instead of `Cmd` and `Alt` instead of `Option`.*

1. **Interrupting an AI Response**: 
- If the AI is composing a reply and you need to stop it immediately, use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+S` or simply hit the stop button in the chat interface.
- You can also interrupt the AI by sending your next message.

2. **Undo/Redo**: You can undo your last action by pressing `Ctrl+Z`. If you want to redo the action, `Ctrl+Shift+Z` on Windows.  You can undo message sends, room changes, and other actions.

3. **Regenerate a Response**: Sometimes you might want the AI to take another crack at the last reply. Simply press the regenerate icon inside the input, or `Ctrl+R` to regenerate the previous response.

4. **Rewrite Last Exchange**: If you feel the need to step back and ask your question differently, use the `Ctrl+D` shortcut. It erases the last AI response and places your original message back into the input area for adjustments.

5. **Verbose Mode for Longer Responses**: When you require more comprehensive replies, engage verbose mode by pressing `Option+V`. This allows you to use the Enter key for line breaks and format your query more expansively. Submit your entry with `Option+Enter`.

6. **Writing Mode for Even Longer Responses**: When you need to provide structured information to the AI, use writing mode by pressing `Option+W`. This opens a resizable editor window that allows you to write longer documents in markdown to submit them all at once by pressing `Option+Enter`.

7. **Load Last Query**: If you need to adjust and resend your last query without modifying the chat history, press `Option+L` to load it into the chat input area. This is particularly useful when you want to build on a previous question or clarify a point and in combination with Writing Mode.

8. **Duplicate Chat for Exploring Different Paths**: With `Option+C`, you can duplicate an ongoing chat. This is particularly useful if you want to pursue different lines of inquiry or discussion without losing the current chat flow.

9. **Focus on the Chat Input Box**: Quickly bring your cursor to the chat input box to type a new message or command by using `Cmd+I` on macOS or `Ctrl+I` on Windows. This shortcut allows you to quickly start typing without having to use the mouse to click into the text area.

10. **Cycle Through Chat Rooms**: You can quickly navigate to the next or previous chat rooms by using `Option+J` to move to the next chat room or `Option+K` to go back to the previous one.

By leveraging these shortcuts and features, you can navigate your conversations more naturally and make the most out of your time with the AI models in Vello.
