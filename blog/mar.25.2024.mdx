title: Vello March Release
description: Performance Improvements, Stability Upgrades, and Exciting Usability Updates
---
March 25, 2023

Before diving into the details of our March release, we wanted to address the feedback we've received regarding GPT models and file access issues over the past month, as well as document support for new Claude models.

We are actively working on our own file and assistant support system that will replace the existing one for all models, including the new Claude models. This update is expected to ship later this week and will be the first release of our custom cognitive architecture, which will power both this feature and persistent memory, tools, and workflows.

Now, let's explore what we are launching today:

## Performance and Stability Enhancements

- Significant performance improvements for code blocks
- Overall stability upgrades
- UI fixes for a smoother user experience
- Image support for new Claude models
- Faster inference for quicker responses

## Quick Access with Space and Model Switchers

- Easily switch between spaces using the shortcut `Option+Ctrl+S`
- Swiftly change models with the shortcut `Option+M`

## Usability Updates for Effortless Chatting and History Rewriting

1. **Interrupting an AI Response**:
   - Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+S` or click the stop button to immediately halt the AI's reply.
   - Alternatively, send your next message to interrupt the AI.

2. **Undo/Redo**:
   - Undo your last action with `Ctrl+Z`.
   - Redo the action with `Ctrl+Shift+Z` on Windows.
   - Applicable to message sends, room changes, and other actions, this is a versatile feature which we will build on in coming releases with tree-based history navigation.

3. **Writing Mode for Even Longer Responses**:
   - Press `Option+W` to open a resizable editor window for structured information input.
   - Write longer documents in markdown and submit them all at once with `Option+Enter`.

4. **Load Last Query**:
   - Adjust and resend your last query without modifying the chat history using `Option+L`.
   - Particularly useful for building on previous questions or clarifying points, especially in combination with Writing Mode.
