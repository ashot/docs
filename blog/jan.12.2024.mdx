Large Language Models are becoming the drafters, the base layer for many segments of work. It makes sense then that this new space of ideation and creation should be shared, with others, as are all of our other work tools.

ChatGPT recently launched its "Teams" feature for enterprise users. In theory, it provides collaborative AI-powered workspaces. In practice, it falls short.

### Where ChatGPT's Teams Product Misses the Mark

Fundamentally, Teams is a billing change, not a new product. There's no shared workspace or visibility into what others are doing. It's individual accounts with consolidated billing - no actual team functionality.

The current offering lacks critical components for real collaboration: ambient awareness, seamless workflows, branching conversations. It feels like a play for multi-seat contracts rather than meaningful innovation.

### The Essence of True Collaboration

Building a robust platform for AI and human teamwork has major technical challenges. But over-promising on collaboration while simply repackaging existing capabilities is disappointing.

The potential, and need is there for real group participation between AI and people. Unfortunately, Teams in its current state doesn't deliver on that promise. For now, it's more sizzle than steak when it comes to true collaborative functionality.
