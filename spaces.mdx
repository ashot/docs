2. **Name Your Space**: As part of creating your space, give it a name that reflects the purpose or nature of the team or project.

3. **Access Space Settings**: In your new space, click the gear icon for settings, located at the top right corner of the interface, or use `Option+,` (or `Alt+,` on Windows) for quick access.

4. **Invite Team Members**:
   - Click the '+' icon next to 'Members' in the space settings.
   - Enter the email addresses of your team members.
   - An invitation will be sent out which they can accept by signing up to Vello with that email address or accepting the invite if they are already a member.
   - Invited members may need to reload the page to see the new space. Once they accept, you can see each other's contributions and edits in real-time.
