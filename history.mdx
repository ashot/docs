title: Managing Conversation History
---

Managing your conversation history effectively is key to maintaining a productive workflow within Vello. Here are the features essential for keeping your chats organized:

1. **Pinning Chats**: Keep important chats easily accessible by pinning them to the top of your chats list. Simply click the pin/unpin icon to the left of any chat. Pinned chats remain at the top for everyone in your space.

2. **Bookmarking Responses**: Bookmark any significant message within a chat to quickly reference it later. Click the bookmark icon to the right of the message to save it to a dedicated bookmarks list.

3. **Searching Conversations**:

   - Use the filter box at the top of the chats list to find specific conversations.
   - Alternatively, utilize the Command-K menu (or Ctrl-K on Windows) for a global search that can bring up past chats across all your spaces.

4. **Archiving Chats**: If you need to declutter your chat list, archive chats by clicking the 'X' in the chat list or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Backspace`. Archived chats can be retrieved if needed later.

5. **Duplicate Chat**: Create a copy of an existing chat by using `Option+C` (or `Ctrl+C` on Windows). This allows you to fork conversations to explore different discussions or ideas while keeping the original thread intact.

With these tools, Vello makes it easy for you to navigate your past and present conversations, ensuring no insights are lost, and your chat space remains organized.
