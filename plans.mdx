### FAQ

**Can I use Vello for free?** Yes, Vello offers a free version with access to a broad range of features. While some limitations apply compared to our premium plans, you’ll find it’s a great way to get started and explore what Vello has to offer.

**Do all plans come with a free trial?** Every premium plan starts with a free trial, giving you the chance to test the full capabilities of Vello. During the trial, you have the option to cancel at any time.

**How long is the free trial, and is there a message cap?** The trial period allows you to use Vello’s premium features for a limited number of days, with a specific message cap in place. This cap is designed to give you a preview of what Vello can do, so you can understand how Vello fits into your workflow.

**What happens after the free trial ends?** Once the trial period is over, you can choose to continue with a premium plan or downgrade to the free version. If you want to continue with a premium plan choose `Activate Paid Plan` in your plan settings, this will remove the free trial limit and start your paid plan instantly.

**Are there any usage limits on the Plus and Pro plans?**
The Plus plan has a weekly limit of approximately 500 calls per model, designed to be generous for most users. The Pro plan is built to offer effectively unlimited access for a single user’s normal use. There are some hourly limits to prevent abuse, but these are set high enough that they shouldn’t affect normal usage.

**What happens if I reach my plan’s limit?**
Limits are put in place to ensure fair usage and system stability. If you reach your limit, you may need to wait until your limit resets to continue using premium services, or consider upgrading to a plan with a higher limit. 

**What are the context size limits?**
See our [models](/models#context-size) page for details on the context size limits for each model.

**Can I switch plans if my needs change?**
Absolutely. You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time directly from your Vello Plan Settings. Choose `View/Upgrade Plan` to see your current plan and available options.

**Can I cancel my subscription at any time?**
Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time. Your subscription will remain active until the end of the billing cycle, at which point you will be downgraded to the free plan. Choose `View/Upgrade Plan` to see your current plan and cancel your subscription.

**What kind of support does the Pro plan include?**
Pro plan subscribers have access to prioritized support, ensuring quicker responses to inquiries and technical support requests.

**Is the Team plan scalable?**
Yes, the Team plan is designed to scale with your team. As you add seats, the limits adjust to ensure that every team member can take full advantage of what Vello has to offer.

**How are the AI personas different across the plans?**
The number of custom AI personas you can create increases with each plan, from three with the Plus plan to unlimited with the Pro and Team plans, empowering you to tailor the Vello experience to your unique requirements.

**Will I be charged during the trial period?**
No, you can try Vello with no obligation. If you choose to continue with a premium plan, billing will start at the end of the trial period.

**Is my data secure with Vello?**
Vello takes data security seriously. We use industry-standard encryption and security measures to protect your data. We do not train on or share your data. For proprietary models, we make a call to the model provider such as OpenAI, Google, or others via a secure connection to their API.  Model providers also have strict data privacy policies in place and do not train on data requests via the API.

### Plan Usage Limits Note
**Usage limits are variable based on capacity, usage, and cost, but are designed to be the most generous available on the market.** Keep in mind that these details are fluid and subject to change, so we recommend staying updated with the latest from our pricing page and announcements.
