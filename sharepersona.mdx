Vello also provides a unique feature that allows you to share the AI personas you create with a broader audience through a public-facing persona site.

#### Publishing a Persona

1. **Start Publishing**: In the edit persona dialog, clicking the 'Publish' button will navigate you to the model publishing page.

2. **Set the Persona Intro**: Craft an engaging intro blurb that introduces users to your persona and explains how they can interact with it. This intro will be visible on the persona's public site.

3. **Preview and Chat**: Before publishing, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to preview your persona and try chatting with it to ensure it's ready for a wider audience.

4. **Publishing and Sharing**: Once you publish the persona, you'll receive a link to its public site. This dedicated space is solely for conversations with your persona.

5. **Customization Options**: The persona site will soon support subdomains and, optionally, your custom domain, offering a more personalized experience.

#### Making Personas Public

1. **Listing in Vello Persona Hub**: By toggling the `public` option on in the persona settings, your persona will be listed in the Vello Persona Hub.

2. **Exploration and Discovery**: Users can explore the Vello Persona Hub, located at https://vello.ai/explore, where they can browse and search a directory of all published personas.

3. **Adding to Team Spaces**: If users find a persona they like, they can add it to their space by clicking 'Add to your space' on any persona card. This allows them to collaborate with the persona within their teams.

4. **Engaging with Personas Outside Team Spaces**: Users also have the option to chat with these personas directly on the Vello Persona Hub, without adding them to a specific space.

Through these sharing capabilities, your AI personas can reach a wide user base, opening up possibilities for feedback, collaboration, community engagement, and soon profit via a revenue sharing program.
